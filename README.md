# AI-Empowered Digital Twin Navigation System for NVIDIA JetBot

## Project Description
This project develops a Digital Twin navigation system for the NVIDIA JetBot, integrating Unity 3D to simulate real-world scenarios with a focus on obstacle detection, avoidance, and guidance. By creating a virtual replica of the JetBot in Unity 3D, the system allows for the safe and efficient testing of navigation algorithms under varied conditions, including complex obstacle-rich environments. The simulation facilitates the study and enhancement of the JetBot's response mechanisms, crucial for reliable obstacle detection and avoidance. A bidirectional communication setup between the virtual and physical JetBot ensures that insights and adaptations from the simulated trials directly inform real-world operations. This innovative approach speeds up the development of effective navigation strategies, reduces the risks and costs of physical testing, and advances the field of autonomous robotic navigation.
